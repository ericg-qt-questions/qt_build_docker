* Build docker_test

	1. docker build . --tag qt

	2. ./docker-qmake

	3. ./docker-make



* From a Ubuntu Desktop install

	1.  Make sure that Qt is installed. I install it with 
	
			./qt-unified-linux-x64-4.0.1-1-online.run --accept-licenses --da --ao --confirm-command install qt.tools.ninja qt.tools.qtcreator qt.tools.cmake qt.qt5.51210.gcc_64
		
		which requires no user-interaction
	   
	2. copy docker_test 

	3. ./docker_test



At this point, the error:

	./docker_test: error while loading shared libraries: libQt5Gui.so.5: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

may appear. In which case, it will be necessary to append to your lib search path. While it is possible to install an apt package to do this, you can use the lib directory from the qt installation.

1. sudo echo "/home/ericg/Qt/5.12.10/gcc_64/lib" >> /etc/ld.so.conf.d/qt.conf
	
	* the path in the echo command will be a little different on your machine.
	
2. sudo ldconfig	

Now that libQt5Gui can be found, ./docker_test will succeed.
